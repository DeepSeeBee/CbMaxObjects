# CbMaxObjects
CLR Adapter for cycling75.max objects and the CbChannelStrip project (dynamic signal flow graph)

## Clone

Clone the repository in your max path which may look like:
C:\Program Files\Cycling '74\Max 8\packages\max-sdk-8.0.3\externals\charly_beck

Using this path will ensure that the project runs though there are some hardcoded development paths around.

## Quickstart

Look at CbChannelStrip\CChannelStrip.cs

This is a sample Max Object using the C# Adapter's (base). The code should be ovious at this state.
